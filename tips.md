# THESE ARE SOME TIPS FOR LEARNING OPERATION SYSTEMS THIS YEAR

1. [Always Make Backup For Your Works](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/813225-best-backup-recovery-memes)<br>
Ah yes, the classic make backup after work. To be honest, I myself don't do this tip very often. But, I do recommend this very much for a lot of people, especially the ones that likes to try everything until destruction happen.
Here are some memes about it...

2. [GSGS™ is the Key of Understanding](https://www.google.com/)<br>
It might come to a surprise for most that our core of understanding for practical skills in this class comes from searching stuff we don't know.
But, that is indeed a fact. Even tough we have Silberschatz as our main books for theoretical understanding, practical stuff comes from practice and practice definitely need some background understanding from people that know more than us.
That is why GSGS™ is da wae. - Zimbabwean Sanik
