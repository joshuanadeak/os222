1. 💻[Introduction To Linux Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)💻<br>
This article is about Linux as a whole, while also giving a little bit of review on operating system. It explains about the history of Linux, the purpose of Linux as an OS, also the benefits when we use Linux. It gives me a big picture of what and how Linux is as a whole in a more friendly sense.

2. 🏭[What Is A Virtual Machine?](https://www.stackpath.com/edge-academy/what-are-edge-vms/)🏭<br>
This is an article that is writing about virtualization and virtual machine on an introductory level. I've picked this article, because the understanding of VM's are very crucial in this course. This is a very good article for beginners to actually give them an idea on understanding Virtual Machines.
