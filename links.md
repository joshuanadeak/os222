## WEEK 00
1. 🔌[Operating Systems Course Site For Assignment and Misc.](https://os.vlsm.org/)🔌<br>
This link contains all our task, infos, and misc. stuff about OS. Which will be the main foundation for our learning especially for noobs like me 😊.

2. 🌎[Google](https://google.com)🌎<br>
This is the main search engine for our studies in OS (you can also use bing though).

3. ❓[How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)❓<br>
This is a video about what is an OS and it's actually quite flashy. For people that actually like animations instead of text based only lectures, this will be nice.

## WEEK 01
4. 💻[Introduction To Linux Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)💻<br>
This article is about Linux as a whole, while also giving a little bit of review on operating system. It explains about the history of Linux, the purpose of Linux as an OS, also the benefits when we use Linux. It gives me a big picture of what and how Linux is as a whole in a more friendly sense.

5. 🏭[What Is A Virtual Machine?](https://www.stackpath.com/edge-academy/what-are-edge-vms/)🏭<br>
This is an article that is writing about virtualization and virtual machine on an introductory level. I've picked this article, because the understanding of VM's are very crucial in this course. This is a very good article for beginners to actually give them an idea on understanding Virtual Machines.

6. 💾[Bash in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g)💾<br>
This is a short (100 second to be precise) video about bash as a whole. This is a very good video for beginners to understand the purpose of Bash and how Bash works as a concept.

## WEEK 02
7. 👮[Cyber Security In 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA)👮<br>
This video will give a basic and brief introduction for cybersecurity, which can give us a picture of what cybersecurity is. It's also quite flashy, so it will not be boring for most people.

8. 📖[Learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org/)📖<br>
This is a website to learn the C-programming language. For me, it is quite helpful.

9. 🔒[How Do Public and Private Key Work?](https://www.preveil.com/blog/public-and-private-key/)🔒<br>
This is an article about the differences between private keys and public keys. It also explains about how it works and why it works like so.

## WEEK 03
10. 📄[Operating System's File System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-systems-in-operating-system/)📄<br>
This is a website (by the classic gfg) that gives an understanding for file systems that we have in OS and also how it works, example some explanation on file allocation.

11. 🐧[Filesystems in Linux](https://likegeeks.com/linux-file-system/)🐧<br>
This is a website that gives us an easy guide about filesystems in Linux. it gives explanation on what are the linux file system types and also how it's used.

12. 🛠️[USE and It's Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)🛠️<br>
This is a website on what is FUSE and how it works. Also, it gives the documentation of FUSE.

## WEEK 04
13. 📚[Static Libraries vs. Dynamic Libraries in Linux](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)📚<br>
This is an article that has a good explanation about the works of static and dynamic libraries in Linux and also how it functions. It is actually quite easy to understand too, so for very recommended for beginners.
14. 🧠[Basics For Memory Mapping](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=memory-understanding-mapping)🧠<br>
This is an article that explains about Memory Mapping and also how it works. It gives quite a lot of knowledge for functions and also syntax used to actually do the memory mapping.
15. 🖥️[C Language Memory Management](https://eleceng.dit.ie/frank/IntroToC/Memory.html)🖥️<br>
This article is quite good to give people some image of how memory management works in C-Language, which is indeed quite interesting. It also shows how the program works too.

## WEEK 05
16. 👓[Operating System's Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)👓<br>
This is an article that describes the concept of virtual memory in the context of operating system. It also has some pictures to visualize the concept of how virtual memory works in operating system.
17. 🧠[Algorithms for Memory Allocation](https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/3rdpartypublic/boost/doc/html/interprocess/memory_algorithms.html)🧠<br>
This is an article that explains about an advanced algorithm using red-black trees to sort the free portions of the memory segment by size. This allows logarithmic complexity allocation. Apart from this, a doubly-linked list of all portions of memory (free and allocated) is maintained to allow constant-time access to previous and next blocks when doing merging operations.
18. 🖼️[C Language Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)🖼️<br>
This article is quite good to give people some image about frame allocation algorithms, that are used if you have multiple processes. It helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process.

## WEEK 06
19. 🚧[Basics for Processes and Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv7mzX8w3jI)🚧<br>
This is a video that describes the basic concept of what a process and thread is. This is a very good video for beginners that want to understand how it function and why we need processes and threads.
20. 🍴[What Is and How Does a Fork() Work?](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)🍴<br>
This is an article that explains about how fork() actually works, it also gives a really good coding example in C on how it actually can be practised. By the function, fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call, the parent process itself.
21. ⛓️[The Difference Between Concurrent and Parallel Processes](https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/concurrency-vs-parallelism-a-brief-review-b337c8dac350)⛓️<br>
This article is quite good to give people a picture on how concurrent and parallel processes work and differ. In here we will understand about multithreading and a lot more, that can help us understand about processes even further.
